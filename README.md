# Alex Newcomer's Computer Science Portfolio

These are three project examples that illustrate my skills in software development.  I created each of these projects on my own and went above any beyond the requirements to make them the best possible versions of these projects.


# [Project 1: LCS, Inc Coffee Shop Application: Project Overview](https://github.com/newcomat/AndroidCoffeeShopApp)
* Created an end-to-end Android Application for a fictional coffee shop
* Native create account and log-in with integrated Firebase Database
* Facebook Log-in implemented
* Full Order Processing system
* Google Maps functionality enabled

## Overview
This project is an Android application for a fictional coffee shop named LCS, Inc. The main programming language I used for this app was Java along with xml for the design of the individual application pages.  This app has simulated order fulfillment, along with a create account/login feature (integrated with Firebase), Facebook login, animations, full menu ordering system, and an integration with Google Maps.  The screenshot below was taken of the landing page after pressing the menu button in the right hand corner.  All of the menu options listed on this page are complete and fully functional.

# [Project 3: Reverse Engineering Software Project: Project Overview](https://github.com/newcomat/ReverseEngineeringProject)
* Reverse Engineered a binary file using assembly language
* Re-wrote the file as a C program and improved security features
* Converted the C file to assembly and then back to binary
* Improved overall functionality of the program and its data structures
