# SNHU Computer Science Degree / Software Engineering Concentration Professional Assessment

  Completing the of the SNHU Computer Science program with a concentration is Software Engineering has helped lay a solid foundation of Computer Science theory and practical application in programming.  When I first decided to pursue a career in Software Development I took the self-guided path by taking classes on edX and buying books to learn Python.  The more research I did the better of an idea it seemed to pursue a formal degree in Computer Science.  The SNHU coursework really built a solid foundation with formal training in three key languages, Python in CS-101, Java in IT-145, and C++ in CS-405 and in other courses.   The key about learning in such a fast-paced environment helped me switch from Python to Java more quickly than I would have on my own and I discovered the differences between programming languages are not as extreme as I thought.  The logic largely remains the same as well as programming theory with the key change being in the syntax.  
	The final project in IT-145 had us complete building a functioning Java program that acted as a cruise ship database where you could create ships and cruises and add them to the database.  This project drilled in object-oriented programming concepts and allowed me to experience working on a large-scale program with moving parts to refine my skills in software development and database structure.  Database education continued with a full course in SQL, followed further in the program with a MongoDB course.  While SQL was a language easy to pick up and very useful, I really learned a lot more when working with MongoDB as it is a more precise and powerful database tool than SQL.  I also learned a lot about the most common security vulnerabilities and how it is imperative to implement security best practices when you are first writing the program.  There were also courses that opened my eyes to project methodologies such as Waterfall and Agile that showed me what it was like to work on the projects day to day.  In addition to the Computer Science courses, some of the math curriculum such as Linear Algebra and Calculus really helped me understand the formulas for key mathematical concepts and how these can be applied within software programs for optimal performance.
	All of the artifacts produced in the CS program helped in my development, but three artifacts in particular demonstrate my overall CS skillset.  These three projects highlight my computer science talents and abilities in the areas of database, software engineering and development, and data structures and algorithms.  For the final project in the MongoDB course I created a Python program in JSON format that connected to my MongoDB database to execute http commands input by the user.  This project highlights my competence interfacing with databases as well as command of the Python language.  Database interface is of paramount importance and I am very comfortable working with both SQL and MongoDB, but I do prefer MongoDB as it has much more robust capability.  
On the software development side, the project where I created an Android application for a fictional coffee shop used all of the skills I had previously learned in the program and more.  The programming language I used for this app was Java along with xml for the design of the application pages.  I learned how to implement Facebook login for this app, as well as connect it to a Google Firebase database for user authentication and to retrieve images for the items on the menu.  This app also has a create account feature (integrated with Firebase), along with animations, full menu ordering system, and simulated order fulfillment.  This project fully illustrates my modular programming abilities along with practical knowledge of how to connect to cloud applications to ensure full application functionality.
The artifact that best exemplifies my abilities in data structures and algorithms is the final project from my Software Reverse Engineering Course.  This assignment provided us with an executable binary file that we had to reverse engineering into a functioning version of the program, using C as the language, that was provided to us and also fix the security risks that were present in the code.  Then, we had to convert the C file into assembly and then finally into an executable binary file.  This capstone project of the course highlights my ability to understand how to work with legacy code in the binary and assembly formats.  This is a keys skill to have as there are a lot of legacy on premise programs that need to have an updated code base to ensure functionality as well as modern security standards.  Completing this project really taught me how higher-level programming languages are converted down to assembly and then binary for the computer to interpret and run the program.  Keeping these concepts in mind will help me write concise and efficient programs in the future as I now have insight into how the computer takes these high-level commands, interprets them, and ultimately executes them.


# [Project 1: LCS, Inc Coffee Shop Application: Project Overview](https://github.com/newcomat/AndroidCoffeeShopApp)
* Created an end-to-end Android Application for a fictional coffee shop
* Native create account and log-in with integrated Firebase Database
* Facebook Log-in implemented
* Full Order Processing system
* Google Maps functionality enabled

## Overview
This project is an Android application for a fictional coffee shop named LCS, Inc. The main programming language I used for this app was Java along with xml for the design of the individual application pages.  This app has simulated order fulfillment, along with a create account/login feature (integrated with Firebase), Facebook login, animations, full menu ordering system, and an integration with Google Maps.  The screenshot below was taken of the landing page after pressing the menu button in the right hand corner.  All of the menu options listed on this page are complete and fully functional.
